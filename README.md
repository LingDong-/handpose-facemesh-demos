Collection of minimalistic demos/templates using [mediapipe handpose with tensorflow.js](https://blog.tensorflow.org/2020/03/face-and-hand-tracking-in-browser-with-mediapipe-and-tensorflowjs.html). Created for and supported by [the Frank-Ratchye STUDIO for Creative Inquiry](https://studioforcreativeinquiry.org/).
