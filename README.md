# Handpose Demos

![](pic.png)

Collection of minimalistic demos/templates using [mediapipe handpose with tensorflow.js](https://blog.tensorflow.org/2020/03/face-and-hand-tracking-in-browser-with-mediapipe-and-tensorflowjs.html). Created for and supported by [the Frank-Ratchye STUDIO for Creative Inquiry](https://studioforcreativeinquiry.org/).

> The handpose package detects hands in an input image or video stream, and returns twenty-one 3-dimensional landmarks locating features within each hand. Such landmarks include the locations of each finger joint and the palm. -- blog.tensorflow.org

There are 4 templates included in this repo, 2 of them with [three.js](https://threejs.org) and 2 with [p5.js](https://p5js.org), 2 are multiplyer via socket.io + express, and 2 are singleplayer static sites. They're all well commented and explained for beginners.

All demos are hosted on [glitch.com](https://glitch.com/) 🎏
